jFactory Starter Kit
====================

This starter kit contains a webpack-dev-server preconfigured to quickly
test a jFactory project on a local server.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/jfactory-es/jfactory-starterkit.git

Starting the server
-------------------

Run in terminal:
    npm run start

Then open:
    http://localhost:8080

If the developer mode is enabled (see process.env.NODE_ENV in webpack.config.js),
you must see the jFactory logs in the console.
Now you can edit app.js, the page will be auto updated.
