# jFactory Starter Kit

A simple demonstration running on a [webpack dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
 to quickly test jFactory.

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jfactory-es/jfactory-starterkit.git
```

## Starting the server

```
npm run start
```

Open in a browser:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Now you can edit app.js, the application is automatically reloaded by webpack.

See the jFactory documentation:
