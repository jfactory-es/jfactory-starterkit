<!--
This small component demonstrates how to automatically stop and remove all views, queries, promise chains, timers, css and dom, in a single command, using [jFactory](https://github.com/jfactory-es/jfactory).
-->

This starter kit provides small applications preconfigured for react, vuejs, dom template and web components. 
There is also a demonstration of instantiable jFactory components.
